# inFlame - built with üèó Scaffold-ETH 2

InFlame is a proof-of-concept house insurance app where users can protect their property with a subscription tied to an ERC4907 NFT. Through Flare's Data Connector (FDC), we aim to automate verification and approval/denial of insurance claims, pulling data from a reputable source (and for demo purposes, we‚Äôre mostly saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to claims for now! ^^).

## Our next steps

Although within the ETHLondon '24 schedule we didn't manage to have too many features/verification layers going on in the app, we'd love to keep going with this project and:

1. Add claim verification by voters using an Optimistic Oracle like UMA, with status updates bridged via FDC.
2. Curate trusted data sources for claim validation and to auto-assess property value.
3. Check eligibility for new policies based on data provided by the user.
4. Set up automated claim payouts based on damage estimates, using UMA oracles for extra support.

## Quickstart

To get started with inFlame, follow the steps below:

1. install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
